# Privacy Policy for Website to Markdown Browser Extension

**Last updated:** December 2024

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how the Website to Markdown browser extension ("we," "our," or "us") handles your information when you use our extension. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

## What This Extension Does

The Website to Markdown browser extension converts web pages to Markdown format. It processes the HTML content of web pages you visit and converts it to clean, readable Markdown text.

## Information We Collect

### What We Do NOT Collect

We want to be clear about what we do NOT collect:

- **No personal information**: We do not collect your name, email address, phone number, or any other personal identifiers
- **No browsing history**: We do not track or store your browsing history
- **No content storage**: We do not store, save, or transmit the content of web pages you convert
- **No analytics**: We do not use analytics tools or tracking cookies
- **No third-party services**: We do not send data to any external services or servers

### What We Do Process (Locally Only)

When you use the extension to convert a webpage to Markdown:

1. **Page Content**: The extension temporarily processes the HTML content of the current webpage in your browser's memory
2. **Page URL**: The extension accesses the current page's URL to include it in the Markdown output
3. **Page Title**: The extension reads the page title to include it in the Markdown output

**Important**: All processing happens locally in your browser. No data leaves your device.

## How We Use Information

The information we process is used solely for:

- Converting the webpage content to Markdown format
- Including the page URL and title in the converted output
- Providing the conversion functionality you requested

## Data Storage and Transmission

### Local Processing Only

All data processing occurs entirely within your browser:
- No data is sent to our servers
- No data is stored on our servers
- No data is shared with third parties
- No data persists after you close the browser tab

### Your Device

The extension operates entirely on your device:
- HTML content is processed in your browser's memory
- Converted Markdown is copied to your clipboard
- No files are saved to your device (unless you manually save them)

## Permissions We Request

The extension requests the following permissions:

- **`activeTab`**: Allows the extension to access the content of the currently active tab when you click the extension icon
- **`scripting`**: Allows the extension to inject scripts into web pages to extract content for conversion

These permissions are necessary for the core functionality of converting web pages to Markdown. They are only used when you actively use the extension.

## Third-Party Libraries

The extension uses the following open-source libraries:

- **Turndown.js**: An HTML to Markdown converter library
- **Marked.js**: A Markdown parser library

These libraries are included locally in the extension and do not make any network requests or collect any data.

## Children's Privacy

This extension does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The extension is designed to be safe for users of all ages.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of any material changes by:

- Updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy

## Legal Basis for Processing

Since we do not collect personal information, no legal basis for processing personal data is required. The extension processes webpage content locally for the legitimate purpose of providing the requested conversion functionality.
